<h1>Spec file editor settings</h1>
<p>Spec file editor should be completely working without any
tweaking of the settings but doing it you should be able to save even
more time.</p>
<h2>Changelog settings</h2>
<center><img src="images/settings_changelog.png" /></center>
<p>Simple properties allowing customizing the generated ChangeLog
entries (Ctrl+Alt+C).<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Be sure to set the Author name and Author email in
ChangeLog plugin preferences so they get properly generated.</p>
<h2>Rpmlint settings</h2>
<center><img src="images/settings_rpmlint.png" /></center>
<p>This page is really useful when you have rpmlint installed in
place different from the default (/usr/bin). The ability to set custom
rpmlint is especially useful during development of quick-fixes or
rpmlint itself.<br>
Another option on this page is whether warnings should be shown for
space usage or for tabs usage, when they are used in a mixed mode in the
spec file.</p>
<h2>Tasks settings</h2>
<center><img src="images/settings_tasks.png" /></center>
<p>This page provides the ability to select the task tags to be used
when searching for tasks. Task tags are looked only in comments. When a
task tag is found it is added to the Tasks view and a marker in the
editor is created. Task tags used by default are TODO and FIXME. Users
have the power to define their own Task tags by just pressing the New
button and entering the new tag (e.g. REMOVE).</p>
<h2>Templates settings</h2>
<center><img src="images/settings_templates.png" /></center>
<p>A list of predefined/generic templates to speed up creation
various fragments of the specfile in the editor.<br>
Provided features match the templates functionality provided by Java
editor. The user can manipulate the list by:
<ul>
	<li>Adding new template</li>
	<li>Editing existing template</li>
	<li>Deleting existing template</li>
	<li>Import a list of templates</li>
	<li>Export the list of templates for future usage on another
	machine or for providing default templates for your team</li>
</ul>
