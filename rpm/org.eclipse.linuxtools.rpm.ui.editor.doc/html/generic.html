<title>Creating and editing a <i><b>spec</b></i> file</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Start editing</h1>
<p>Starting editing should be as simple as double click on any of
the spec files in your projects or going through the File/Open File
procedure and select your spec file.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> It is strongly recommended that you always have your
spec file in a project inside Eclipse workspace to take the most of the
editor. Rpmlint integration, some auto-completion and hyperlink are not
available when you are editing external (for the workspace) file.</p>
At this stage you should see something nice looking like this:

<h1>Create new spec file</h1>
<p>Part of the plugin is a wizard for creating new specfile. It can
be invoked from the menu File/New/Other which should bring the following
dialog where you can select "New specfile based on a template".</p>

<p>Dialog providing options and interface for filling the data in
the spec file should appear at this stage.</p>
