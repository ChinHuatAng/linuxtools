<p>To disable rpmlint warnings just execute the same steps again.</p>
<h1>Benefits from rpmlint integrations</h1>
<h2>Warnings for common mistakes</h2>
<p>After rpmlint warnings are enabled new Rpmlint project builder is
added to the project builders and the reported warnings/errors are
showed as markers in the editor view.</p>

<p>For better integration with the Eclipse platform these warnings
are also added to the Problems view.</p>

<h2>Fix the warnings</h2>
<p>Part of the rpmlint integration is the ability to provide quick
fixes for some of the reported warnings. While not providing quick fixes
for all the fixes available in rpmlint, the number of fixes is
constantly improving. If you want to see a quick fix for the most
disturbing for you warning please report it <a
	href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Linux%20Distros">here</a>
against the RPM component.</p>
<p>To execute some quick fix right click on the warning/error in the
Problems view and select "Quick fix" or just use the shortcut Ctrl+1
with a selected warning. In the dialog that appears</p>

appear in the specfile editor. For comparison look at the following
screenshots - Before and After.</p>
