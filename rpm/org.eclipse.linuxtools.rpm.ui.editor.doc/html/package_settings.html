<h1>Generic setup</h1>
<p>Using distribution specific tools enhances auto-completion for
packages with not only installed rpm files but also with the packages
available in the online repositories. Support is there for YUM and URPMI
tools. Users of other tools should contact us to find a way for adding
support for them. If none of the distribution tools is selected packages
auto completion will contains only the installed packages.</p>

<h1>Package details</h1>

packages to show details for and what RPM tags should the hover
