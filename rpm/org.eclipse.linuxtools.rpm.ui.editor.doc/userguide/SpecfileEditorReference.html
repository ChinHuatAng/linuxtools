		<h2 id="Basic_introduction">Basic introduction</h2>
		<p>This editor provides a great number of features to make your *.spec files editing better. One of the most valued parts is the rpmlint which assist in finding the most common mistakes made in RPM spec files and also a quick way to fix some of this warnings. It also tries to provide all the nice features you have seen in JDT. Just to name a few:</p>
		<pre>   * Outline view and quick outline in the editor
   * Various auto-completions
   * Highlighting
   * Hyperlinks - both inside the file and to external resouces
   * Folding and etc.
</pre>
		<h2 id="Start_editing">Start editing</h2>
		<p>Starting editing should be as simple as double click on any of the spec files in your projects or going through the File/Open File procedure and select your spec file.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> It is strongly recommended that you always have your spec file in a project inside Eclipse workspace to take the most of the editor. Rpmlint integration, some auto-completion and hyperlink are not available when you are editing external (for the workspace) file.
			At this stage you should see something nice looking like this:

		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ Specfile_new_from_template.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Description of the fields:</p>
