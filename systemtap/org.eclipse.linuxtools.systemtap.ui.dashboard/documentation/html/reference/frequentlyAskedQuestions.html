Frequently Asked Questions
</h2>

This section details frequently asked questions relating to the Dashboard Perspective.<br/><br/>

<b>
Can more than one module be open at any given time?
</b><br/><br/>

A: SystemTap GUI supports the execution of more than one module at one time. The currently running script does not
not to be halted and the currently open graphs do not need to be closed, though they may be if desired. To 
execute another module, simply select and run it as described previously . If you were to
run the Page Faults module in the Memory module family for example, an additional tab will be created for 
the Memory module family <br/><br/>


<b>
How many graphs may be opened at one time?
</b><br/><br/>

A: Currently, 8 in each tab(i.e, 8 per module family). You may close graphs to make more room by using the closebox.

<b>
Is there an option to pause specific graphs?
</b><br/><br/>

A: No. You can pause or stop a specific module, which will in turn pause or stop the specific graphs associated
with it, but you cannot pause or stop just one graph unless that module produces just one graph or you close all
but that graph.
