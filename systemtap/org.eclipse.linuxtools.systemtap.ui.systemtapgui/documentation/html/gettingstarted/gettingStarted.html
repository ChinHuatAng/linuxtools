<h1>SystemTap Development User Guide</h1>

Welcome to the SystemTap Development Help pages. This section is intended to provide users with information
and links about the SystemTap scripting language itself, in addition to a brief introduction to SystemTap
GUI's structure for new users and a brief explanation of SystemTap.

<h2>SystemTap GUI's Plugin Design</h2>

SystemTap GUI was built with a modular goal in mind, namely, to provide the application as a series of 
plugins so that users may obtain just the ones they need without having to use a heavy-weight application
should if they didn't need to. The most common example of this is to ship the Dashboard plugin 
independently, allowing non-SystemTap savvy users the ability to execute modules without having to write
any scripts. The application in its complete state includes three perspective, each with a specific goal:

<ul>
<li><b>IDE Perspective</b> - Contains script editor and Function, Kernel Source, and Probe Alias browsers
to assist in the creation and editting of SystemTap scripts.</li>
<li><b>Graphics Perspective</b> - Graphs data from SystemTap scripts in the desired graph form according 
to a regular expression passed to interpret the data.</li>
<li><b>Dashboard Perspective</b> - Allows the execution of modules, which are scripts with associated 
metadata that open one or more graphs in a dashboard environment that update in real time.This perspective
is still under development</li>
</ul>

Each perspective has full documentation associated with it and is packaged in the respective plugin.

<h2>
Systemtap
</h2>

SystemTap provides free software (GPL) infrastructure to simplify the gathering of information about the 
running Linux kernel. This assists diagnosis of a performance or functional problem. SystemTap eliminates 
the need for the developer to go through the tedious and disruptive instrument, recompile, install, and 
reboot sequence that may be otherwise required to collect data.<br><br>

SystemTap provides a simple command line interface and scripting language for writing instrumentation for a 
live running kernel. The internal tapset library as well as the published samples can be used to  
aid reuse and abstraction. <br><br>

Current project members include Red Hat, IBM, Intel, and Hitachi.<br><br>

<h2>
Configuration Tutorial
</h2>

This tutorial is written to guide a new SystemTap GUI user through some basic post-installation setup in
order to get the most out of the application.<br>

<h3>Installation</h3>

If SystemTap GUI is not yet installed, or for problems in basic installation, please see the <a href="installation.html">
installation help page</a>.

<h3>Kernel Source Location</h3>

In order to use the kernel source browser you'll need to point it to the kernel source initially. Do this by 
either selecting the Kernel Source Browser in the browser pane or by going to 
<b><u>W</u>indow-><u>P</u>references</b>, then going to the SystemTap->IDE->Path tab and setting the location
there. This configuration detail is relevent to the IDE Perspective only.

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

If you haven't already, you will want to take the IDE and Graphing tutorials. You can find them in the Getting 
Started section of each perspective's help pages. These tutorial provides fundamental knowledge on graphing in SystemTap GUI.

<h3>Preferences (Optional)</h3>

Finally, you may want to set certain non-essential preferences before using SystemTap GUI regularly. Use
<b><u>W</u>indow-><u>P</u>references</b> to access the Preferences page. 

Of particular note are 
Logging->Log To, SystemTap->Environment Variables, SystemTap->Graphing->Refresh Delay, 
SystemTap->IDE->Editor->Syntax Coloring.
