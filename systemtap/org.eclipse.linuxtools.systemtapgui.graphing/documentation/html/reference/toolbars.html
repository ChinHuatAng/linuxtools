<h2>
Toolbars
</h2>


SystemTap GUI currently has two toolbars built in; an Action Bar for file and execution operations and a Perspective Selector to jump to different perspectives.

<h3>
Action Bar
</h3>

<ul>
<li><img src="images/toolbars/open_wiz.gif"> <b>Open Script Output</b> - This option opens the specified file and reads the contents into the DataTable for use in the Graphing Perspective.</li>
<li><img src="images/toolbars/save_wiz.gif"> <b>Save Graph Image</b> - This option saves the graph in the specified file extension format.</li>
<li><img src="images/toolbars/import_wiz.gif"> <b>Import Data Set</b> - This option allows you to load a previously saved set of data obtained from running a SystemTap script. You can proceed from this point as if you had just ran a script and populated the DataTable.</li>
<li><img src="images/toolbars/export_wiz.gif"> <b>Export Data Set</b> - This option allows you to save a current data set after you've ran a script in the intention of having someone else look at the user's script results through the tool or for further work done by the user.</li>
<li><img src="images/toolbars/stop_obj.gif"> <b>Stop Script</b> - This button will stop the currently active script from running.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Perspective Selector
</h3>

<ul>
<li><img src="images/toolbars/ide.png"> <b>IDE Perspective</b> - This button brings you into the IDE Perspective, useful for writing and executing scripts.</li>
<li><img src="images/toolbars/graphing.png"> <b>Graphing Perspective</b> - This button brings you into the Graphing Perspective, useful for graphing scripts.</li>
</ul>
