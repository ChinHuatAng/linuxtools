Introduction
</h2>

The Graphing Perspective in the SystemTap GUI is a perspective that is active once a user runs a script with
the chart option (<b><u>R</u>un-&gt;Run w/ <u>C</u>hart</b>). From this point a
<a href="../concepts/dataTable.html">DataTable</a> is populated with live data as it is parsed from the Console. 
From the information in the DataTable you can generate the following graphs:

<ul>
<li><a href="../concepts/graphTypes/barGraph.html">Bar Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="../concepts/graphTypes/multiBarGraph.html">Multi-Bar Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="../concepts/graphTypes/lineGraph.html">Line Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="../concepts/graphTypes/multiLineGraph.html">Multi-Line Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="../concepts/graphTypes/scatterGraph.html">Scatter Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="../concepts/graphTypes/multiScatterGraph.html">Multi-Scatter Graph</a></li>
</ul>

These graph types can be used instantiated by using the Graph Wizard once the DataTable is populated.
The Graphing Perspective can support multiple graphs from one DataTable. Each are updated and can
be viewed by navigating through the tabs shown at the top of each graph.<br/><br/>
