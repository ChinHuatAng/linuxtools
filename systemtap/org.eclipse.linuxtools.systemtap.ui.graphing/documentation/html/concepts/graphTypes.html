Graph Types
</h2>

Currently there are six graph types built into SystemTap GUI. They are:
<ul>
<li><a href="graphTypes/barGraph.html">Bar Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="graphTypes/multiBarGraph.html">Multi-Bar Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="graphTypes/lineGraph.html">Line Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="graphTypes/multiLineGraph.html">Multi-Line Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="graphTypes/scatterGraph.html">Scatter Graph</a></li>
<li><a href="graphTypes/multiScatterGraph.html">Multi-Scatter Graph</a></li>
</ul>

These graph types can be used instantiated by using the Graph Wizard once the DataTable is populated.
The Graphing Perspective can support multiple graphs from one DataTable. Each are updated and can
be viewed by navigating through the tabs shown at the top of each graph.
