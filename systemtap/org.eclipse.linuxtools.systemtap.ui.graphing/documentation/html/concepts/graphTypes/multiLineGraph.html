<h2>
Multi-Line Graph
</h2>

A Multi-Line Graph is useful for contrasting multiple series of data on a fixed interval, such as time.<br/><br/>

Creating a Multi-Line Graph will prompt the user for four values. The first is the title and is fully cosmetic. The 
option to turn on and off the title is given to the user, and its off by default. The second option is X Series; 
here you select which series of data you want to plot along the X Axis. The third option is the first Y Series; here 
you select one of the series of data you want to plot along the Y Axis. The fourth option is the second Y series;
here you select the other series of data you want to plot along the Y Axis.<br/><br/>
