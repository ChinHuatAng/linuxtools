<h2>
Bar Graph
</h2>

The Bar Graph typically uses bars to show frequencies or values.<br><br>

Creating a Bar Graph will prompt the user for three values. The first is the title and is fully cosmetic. The 
option to turn on and off the title is given to the user, and its off by default. The second option is X Series; 
here you select which series of data you want to plot along the X Axis. The third option is the Y Series; here 
you select which series of data you want to plot along the Y Axis.<br><br>
