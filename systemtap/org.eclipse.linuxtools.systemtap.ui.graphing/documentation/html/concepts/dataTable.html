<h2>
DataTable
</h2>

The DataTable is the default view the user sees when running a script with the chart option. It 
intitially starts empty and populates as it recieves information parsed from the console originally
from the script. The DataTable is a visualization of the data structure that every other graph type 
spawns from.<br><br>

The columns of the DataTable can be resized at will by dragging the seperation lines between column
headers. In addition, the information in the data table can be <a href="../tasks/importDataSet.html">
saved and loaded</a> without having to re-run the script. Furthermore, the user can populate the 
DataTable without having to run a script if a script's output has been saved into a file, see
<a href="../tasks/openScriptOutput.html">Opening Script Output</a>.<br><br>
