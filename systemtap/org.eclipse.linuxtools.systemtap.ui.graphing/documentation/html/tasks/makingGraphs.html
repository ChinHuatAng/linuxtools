<h2>
Making Graphs
</h2>

In order to graph SystemTap scripts you must have a script open in the IDE Perspective, and the <b><u>R</u>un->Run 
w/ Chart</b> option must be used. If you are unfamiliar with how to load or write a SystemTap script, please 
review the IDE Tutorial in the SystemTap IDE User's Guide.<br><br>

A <a href="../gettingstarted/graphingTutorial.html">tutorial</a> has been written to guide the user through the execution 
and charting of a provided script. Any script can be used however that provides consistent data along with a 
regular expression (regex). For instructions on using regex see our 
<a href="../reference/regex.html">Regex Reference Page</a>.<br><br>
