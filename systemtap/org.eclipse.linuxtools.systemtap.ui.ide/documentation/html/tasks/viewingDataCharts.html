<h2>
Viewing Data Charts
</h2>

Viewing data charts from a SystemTap script is accomplished by running that script with the 
<b><u>R</u>un-><u>R</u>un w/ Chart</b> option. This is covered in the 
<a href="../gettingstarted/IDETutorial/lesson3.html">IDE Tutorial: Lesson Three</a>. After running a script
with the chart option, the user is taken into the Graphing Perspective and the Data Table is loaded by
default. The data table immediately begins populating as it recieves input back through the console from
the running SystemTap script.<br><br>
