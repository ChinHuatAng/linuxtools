<h2>
Creating SystemTap Scripts
</h2>

Create a SystemTap script by selecting <b><u>F</u>ile-><u>N</u>ew</b> in the IDE Perspective. You'll be 
prompted to enter a name for the file; <i>make sure that you use a .stp extension or else SystemTap GUI
will not recognize the file as a SystemTap script and certain editor and run features will not be active.</i> 
Your new file will be open and ready for coding in the Editor pane.<br><br>

A <a href="../gettingstarted/IDETutorial.html">full length tutorial</a> is also provided in the help pages
for a step by step demo.<br><br>

For advanced SystemTap langauge help please see the SystemTap Development User's 
Guide and <a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/documentation.html">the SystemTap website's documentation
