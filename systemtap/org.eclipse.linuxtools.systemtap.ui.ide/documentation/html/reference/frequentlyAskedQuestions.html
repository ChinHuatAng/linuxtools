Frequently Asked Questions
</h2>

This section details frequently asked questions relating to the IDE Perspective.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/>

<b>

<br/><br/><br/>

<b>
Why does the application seem to hang when switchign to the IDE Perspective?
</b><br/><br/>

A: If this is the first time you are trying to open the IDE perspective, or have recently gotten a new version of SystemTap this is expected.  In order to generate a full list of all of the available probes, and functions the GUI has to run the stap command.  If there are tapsets that do not run correctly using the 'stap -up2' comamnd this takes a long time.  In order to build as complete a list as possible it will use a binary filtering algorithm to figure out which tapset function is broken and generate data for all of the others.
