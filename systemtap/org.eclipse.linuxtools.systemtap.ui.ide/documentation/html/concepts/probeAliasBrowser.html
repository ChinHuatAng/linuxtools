<h2>
Probe Alias Browser
</h2>

The Probe Alias Browser lists all of the probe aliases that are defined in the tapset library.  Probes are grouped based on their type.  In addition to the list of probes, each probe lists all of the variables that it has access to.  Each variable is listed with an icon that represents its type.  Types are as follows:

<ul>
<li><img src="images/var_str.gif"> String</li>
<li><img src="images/var_long.gif"> Long</li>
<li><img src="images/var_unk.gif"> Unknown</li>
</ul>

If you double click on any probe alias, probe point will be added to the end of the active editor.  Also if you right click on a probe and click "View Definition" the tapset file where the probe is defined will be opened.<br><br>
