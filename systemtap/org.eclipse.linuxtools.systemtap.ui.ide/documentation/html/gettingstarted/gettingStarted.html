Systemtap GUI is a tool being developed to assist in writing SystemTap scripts and viewing kernel performance.

Systemtap scripts can be used to insert probes into the Linux kernel, where they can monitor various system activities and provide information back based on what is going on. The goal of the Systemtap GUI project is to provide three things. The first is an IDE to assist Systemtap scripts. Secondly, a data collection and graphical display that users can use to visually see what is happening in the kernel. Finally, a dashboard with an number of precanned scripts for users to use without having to write their own scripts.

The current code drop comes with the IDE Perspective and the Graphical Perspective. Subsequent installments will include updates to these features as well as the Dashboard perspective.
